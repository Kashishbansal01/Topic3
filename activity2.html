		<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size: 120px;">Smart building</h1>
		<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;"> A smart building is one that makes use of technology to provide residents with a safe and comfortable environment while enabling efficient and economical resource use. Smart HVAC systems that can optimise air conditioning consumption and smart lighting systems that can detect occupancy and turn off lights in specific rooms or hallways when no one is in them are examples of important building features. </p>

		<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;">Tasks like monitoring building temperature, security, and maintenance via mobile devices and computers are made simpler by smart buildings, which integrate building activities through the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> <b>Some Smart-building Scenarios</p></b>
<ul><li>Carbon-monoxide monitoring to keep the AQI at the proper level.</li>
<li>HVAC: Controlling Building Temperature, Security, and Maintenance using remote CCTV and exit monitoring systems.</li>
<li>Identify occupancy by looking for movement within the designated range.</li>
